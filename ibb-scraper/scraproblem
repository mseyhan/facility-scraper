Hey! now you'll help me solve a scraping bug. I'll describe the problem to you.

I attached a screenshot of the website I'd like to scrape. I'll give you the html code of this part for that website too.

As you can see, there are buttons as Rezervasyon, and there are time slots. 

I produced a working code with a bug. Everything works perfectly but the problem is,

Whenever I run my code, it clicks the first Reservation button in the right column for the right date.

I want it to click on the button that is clearly stated in my config file. e.g 11:00 - 12:00

when I run my code for 11:00 - 12:00, it gets 07:00 - 08:00 as the first Rezervasyon button that it sees. We should change something, but what?

If I'm sure you understood the task, I'll start by giving you the html, then in my other message i'll give you the necessary code.
